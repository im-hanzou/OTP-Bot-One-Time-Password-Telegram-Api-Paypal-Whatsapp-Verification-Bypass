## Question & Answer

### How OTP Bots Work

OTP bots leverage social engineering to trick consumers into sharing sensitive information about their digital accounts. Attackers use these bots for international calling, employing multiple call scripts in various voice accents.

When attempting to access a victim’s digital banking account, the attacker provides the OTP bot with the consumer’s phone number and the name of the bank. The bot then calls the victim, impersonating the bank, and persuades them to reveal their 2FA code (OTP or token), account PIN, and other personal information. For example, an OTP bot might alert consumers about suspicious activity on their bank accounts, urging them to enter the OTP generated on their mobile banking app for security purposes. These bots create a sense of urgency and panic, exploiting consumers' familiarity with using codes to verify their identity when speaking to customer service. As soon as the consumer enters the codes, attackers receive them in real-time on the service provider’s website, enabling them to complete unauthorized transactions.

### In Which Countries Does It Work?

OTP bots are operational in:

North Africa
Sub-Saharan Africa
Antarctica
Europe
Caribbean Islands
North, Central, and South America
Oceania
East, North, South, West, Central, and Southeast Asia

### What Can I Do With It?

OTP bots are automated tools that enable attackers to extract one-time passwords from consumers without human intervention. Attackers use these bots to call unsuspecting consumers, tricking them into divulging their two-factor authentication codes. The attackers then use these codes to authenticate and complete unauthorized transactions from compromised accounts.
